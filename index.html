  <h3>Hello! I'm Eugene Chong</h3>
  
  <p>I am learning to become a software developer living near Birmingham, Alabama. I used to work in lipid manufacturing as a shift process technician specializing in rotary evaporation but recently stepped away from that to focus my efforts in this bootcamp.</p>
  <hr> <!-- I use a horizontal rule to separate my "intro" and "about me" sections -->
    
<h3>About Me</h3> 
  
  <p>After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in Biology, I pursued a career in lipid manufacturing. About a year or so of working at my former workplace, I wanted to find a career where I would constantly be challenged and I felt that software was that area. I have enjoyed this bootcamp simply because I am learning something new each and every day. I am not sure what kind of developing I am interested in quite yet but I am excited to see where this journey takes me. 
    Outside of this bootcamp:</p><ul><!-- I used an unordered list to list my hobbies -->
      <li>I enjoy playing pickleball</li>
      <li>I exercise doing Crossfit</li>
      <li>I love walking my two dogs</li>
</ul>
